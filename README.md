## Assignment Q1: Merge Two Arrays

### Problem Statement

Merge two sorted arrays `X[]` and `Y[]` of size `m` and `n` each where \( m \geq n \) and `X[]` has exactly `n` vacant cells. Merge elements of `Y[]` in their correct position in array `X[]`, i.e., merge `(X, Y)` by keeping the sorted order.

#### Constraints

- \( m \geq n \)
- `X[]` has exactly `n` vacant cells
- All elements in `X[]` and `Y[]` are integers


#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m + n)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\).

---

## Assignment Q2: Maximum Sum Path

### Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays of integers, find a maximum sum path involving elements of both arrays whose sum is maximum. We can start from either array, but we can switch between arrays only through its common elements.

#### Constraints

- All elements in `X[]` and `Y[]` are integers


#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m + n)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\).

## Assignment Q3: Count Words in a String using HashMap

### Problem Statement

Write a Java Program to count the number of words in a string using HashMap.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\).

---

## Assignment Q4: Find Duplicate Characters in a String

### Problem Statement

Write a Java Program to find the duplicate characters in a string.


#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\).
